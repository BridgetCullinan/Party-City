            <h1> I LOVE PARTY CITY </h1>
                <p> Party City is a big part of my life; and many lives before mine. 
                    The first Party City opened in 1986, and my life has never been the same ever since. Even though 23 people have died in the aisles of PC (thats what the cool kids call it) I still long to go in there everyday. I walk past cheap platic and smell how good it smells to have a fun little party time. I eat their crumpy food that tastes exactly like the plastic smells (like plastic). One time there was a hurricane and party city opened its doors to me to shelter me from the cold winds that were, at one point in time, pelting my face. I love listening to 2014 pop music when I am shoping there. In conclusion--wait stop no--- I am agent Paierre with the part city closing agency. This cite will shut down in 10 seconds leaving everyone on it with 1 billion viruses... 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 BOOM!!!!!!!!  </p>
